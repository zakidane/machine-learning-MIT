# machine-learning-MIT

The lab assignments are part of MIT 6.034 Artificial Intelligence, Fall 2010 course. The python assignments can be tested by running python tester.py. Some code from the following link was referenced to complete these labs: https://github.com/wangjohn/mit-courses 

1. Lab0 - Basic python skill-tests
2. Lab1 - Rule-Based Systems: Backward chaining and forward chaining 
3. Lab2: Hill-Climbing, Beam, A* and Best-Frist Searches implementation. Only Hill-Climbing Search is complete.
4. Lab3: Game Search implementations with ConnectFour Game. A game evaluation function (focused_evaluation) and minimax search with alpha-beta pruning (function alpha_beta_search) are implemented and pass all tests. The remaining functions have not been implemented.
5. Lab4: This lab covers constraint satisfaction problems and learning with identification trees. Functions forward_checking, forward_checking_prop_singleton and euclidean_distance have been completed. All tests that test these functions pass, that is, 7 out of 13 tests.
