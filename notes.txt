Functions To Be Completed: 

Forward Checking
	Let X be the variable currently being assigned.
	Let x be the value being assigned to X.
	Find all the binary constraints that are associated with X.
	For each constraint:
		1. Let Y be the variable connected to X by that binary constraint.
		2. For each variable value y in Y's domain
		1. If constraint checking fails for X=x and Y=y
		1. Remove y from Y's domain
		2. If the domain of Y is reduced down to the empty set, then the entire check fails:
		return False.
		5. If all constraints passed declare success, return True
